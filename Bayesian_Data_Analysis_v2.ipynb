    "How one conducts and interprets statistical inferences has been the subject of much debate for many decades.  In the 20th century, the debate was mostly over the <b>Frequentist</b> vs. the <b>Fisherian</b> approaches.  The <b>Bayesian</b> approach was also around during that time, but did not become practical until the 1990s with the advent of efficient simulation methods, such as <b>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</b>, and widespread access to powerful computers. Here, I'll refer the Frequentist and Fisherian approaches as the <b>Classical</b> approach. Today, the debate over how to conduct and interpret statistical inference is more about the Classical vs. Bayesian approaches."
