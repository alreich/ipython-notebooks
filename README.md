[Monoids 101 for Apache Spark](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/alreich/132e9bd0a396168aa1d0) -- This notebook describes what monoids are and the role they play in reduction and aggregation in Spark, specifically PySpark.  The following types of examples are included here, using reduce and reduceByKey to illustrate the use of the monoid concept:
    Word count
    Max/Min as monoids
    Histogram Calculation using Vectors as Monoids
    Calculating Sample Means and Standard Deviations
    Calculating Covariances and Correlations using Vectors and Matrices as Monoids
    Sets as monoids
    A HyperLogLog monoid (a Sketch Method for approximating set cardinality)

[Extreme Value Theory (EVT)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/alreich/8854279) -- Describes EVT calculations using an example from Stuart Cole's book, "An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values".  The calculations are done using both Python and R.  It is noted that there does not appear to be a standard representation of the GEV distribution. Algorithms appear to differ on how the shape parameter, Î¾, should be represented. Specifically, the shape parameter in the ismev package in R is the negative of the shape parameter in scipy.stats.genextreme.

[Quantile Example using R-8 Method](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/alreich/8984544) -- Examples of quantiles for a random sample of integers are computed here using two versions of the R-8 method: (1) the 'mquantile' function found in scipy.stats.mstats and (2) a simple implementation based on the description of the R-8 method in Wikipedia.
